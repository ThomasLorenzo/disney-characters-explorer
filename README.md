## üì° About the API

This project uses a fan-made Disney API created by [Manu Castrillon](https://github.com/ManuCastrillonM). The API provides character data including names, images, films, series, and wiki links.

### API Limitations

- **Image Quality**: Some character images may appear broken or have poor resolution due to the nature of the data source.
- **Search Scope**: Character search is limited to the current page only, as the API doesn't provide a global character search endpoint.
- **Reliability**: Being a fan-made service, occasional downtime or data inconsistencies may occur.
